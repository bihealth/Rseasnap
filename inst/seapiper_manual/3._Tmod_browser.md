Tmod browser consists, like the Gene browser, of two panes.

On the upper pane, the gene set enrichment analysis results are shown for
the selected contrast and selected gene set enrichment data base (chosen
from drop down menus on the left panel). The table includes the gene set ID,
gene set name ("Title"), effect size (AUC, area under curve), p-value and
p-value corrected for multiple testing.

Clicking on the selection button in the table allows to investigate in
detail the enrichment by showing the evidence plot (ROC curve) in the lower
panel.
