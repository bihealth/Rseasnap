seaPiper is a browser / viewer app for the sea-snap pipeline output. In
itself, it does not perform any analyses, but rather visualizes the results
and allows an interactive exploration of the pipeline output.

The main elements of the pipeline can be accessed through the menu on the
left. Currently, the following elements have been defined:

 * **Gene browser** showing the output of differential gene expression
   analysis and allowing to plot the individual genes

 * **Tmod browser** for exploration of the gene set enrichment analyses
   with the tmod R package.

 * **Disco - discordance / concordance analysis** allows to compare
   the results of individual contrasts by plotting the log fold changes
   from the contrasts to be compared

 * **PCA â€“ Principal component analysis** showing 2D and 3D plots of the
   principal components from gene expression

 * **Pipeline info** details of the pipeline run including the covariate
   table.
