Disco (discordance / concordance) plots allow to compare two contrasts. On
the plot, each dot represents a gene. The X axis values are the log~2~ fold
changes from the first selected contrast, and the Y axis values are the
log~2~ fold changes from the second selected contrast.

Colors correspond to the disco metric defined by Domaszewska et al. (2017).
Red color shows *concordant* genes: genes that have low p-values and show a
similar change in both contrasts. Blue color shows *discordant* genes, for
which the log~2~ fold changes in both contrasts have opposite signs.

Genes can be selected either by clicking on the data points directly or by
clicking and dragging the mouse to select more than one gene.
