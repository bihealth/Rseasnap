The gene browser tab consists of two main panes: top – Gene table – and
bottom – Gene info. 

The upper pane contains two panels: left panel allows selecting contrasts
and threshold values, and the right panel a table with one row per gene
showing the log~2~ fold changes, p-values and FDR (p-values corrected for
multiple testing).  The values correspond to the contrast which is selected
from the drop-down menu in the left panel.

The buttons in the table allow to select a gene for viewing in the lower
pane.

In the lower pane, left panel allows to choose the covariates shown on the
plot as symbols and colors and to save the graphics as a PDF file. Right
panel shows details of the selected gene and consists of two tabs. The
first tab shows a plot of the normalized gene counts, while the second tab
is a table showing the differential expression analysis results for each of
the defined contrasts (if no contrasts were defined, the tab is absent).
