A collection of functions which make it easy to access the files and
objects created by the sea-snap DE pipeline.

Why Rseasnap:

 * shortcuts for accessing pipeline objects

Why not part of sea-snap distribution (e.g. as R scripts):

 * better documentation
 * can be used for other tasks as well
 * easier to maintain
