\arguments{
\item{x}{pipeline object returned by \code{load_de_pipeline()}}

\item{id}{PrimaryID of the gene (usually ENSEMBL ID)}

\item{xCovar}{the x covariate â€“ column name from the covariate table}

\item{rld}{gene expression matrix to show on the y axis; rownames must
be PrimaryIDs. If NULL, the rld object from the pipeline is used.}

\item{annot}{annotation data frame (as returned by the get_annot()
function). If empty, it will be loaded.}

\item{covar}{the covariate data frame containing the column \code{xCovar}}

\item{groupBy}{name of the covariate column by which to group and connect by lines the data points}

\item{colorBy}{name of the covariate column by which to color the data}

\item{symbolBy}{name of the covariate column by which to select point symbols}
}
